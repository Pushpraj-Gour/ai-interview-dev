# Project idea main
"""
I am building a project that simulates a demo or mock interview experience. The process begins by receiving a user's profile details (such as a resume) via an API. Based on this information, I will use a language model to generate personalized interview questions.

The goal is to create a real-time, audio-based interview simulation where the user can participate via common platforms (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, or any platform that allows integration). The system will:

1. Present the first question to the user.
2. Capture and transcribe the user's audio response in real-time.
3. Immediately store the response in text format.
4. Prompt the next question once the previous response is complete.
5. Continue this process until all questions are asked and answered.

After the interview, all questions and transcribed responses will be passed to a language model (LLM) for evaluation. The LLM will then generate a report assessing the user's performance and providing feedback.

Currently, I have developed the part of the system that generates questions using an API and a language model. I need guidance on how to proceed with the real-time audio interaction, including:

1. Choosing the right platform for live audio interviews.
2. Capturing and transcribing audio responses in real time.
3. Asking the next question seamlessly after each response.
4. Evaluating and generating feedback after the session.
5. The entire system will be audio-only—no video involved.

# Project idea first draft
"""
I am building a project that simulates a demo or mock interview experience. The process begins by receiving a user's profile details (such as a resume) via an API. Based on this information, I will use a language model to generate personalized interview questions.

The goal is to create a real-time, audio-based interview simulation.

1. Present the first question to the user by making an API call.
2. Now as soon as the user starts speaking, capture their audio response from a button click, which is there to start the recording and as soon as the user is done, they can stop the recording.
3. Prompt the next question once the previous response is complete.
4. Continue this process until all questions are asked and answered as there will be a button to end the interview.

After the interview, all questions and audio responses which were passed to backed the backend will make a call to language model (LLM) for evaluation. The LLM will then generate a report assessing the user's performance and providing feedback.

Currently, I have developed the part of the system that generates questions using an API and a language model. Now I am working for the next parts help me to complete the project. Next steps include:

1. Creating a front-end interface for the user to interact with.
2. Implementing real-time audio capture and send to the backend.
4. Evaluating and generating feedback after the session.

The entire system will be audio-only—no video involved.

If till now everything is clear, then I am having some node.js code which is used to generate the questions and then I will be using the same code to generate the audio questions and then send it to the backend. if you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask or else I need assistance with the node.js code, to add some more functionality to it.
